  <h1>Dutch Pancakes</h1>
  <div class="recipe-description">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My family moved here from Holland just before I was born. These Dutch
      pancakes, a little thicker and eggier than a crepe, are eaten in our
      family for breakfast or dinner. Serve rolled and topped with real maple
      syrup, fried apples, jam, or sugar. Leftovers are good eaten cold.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat eggs with a whisk in a large bowl. Add flour and whisk until
        mixture is smooth. Whisk in milk, sugar, and oil until well combined.
        Batter should be the consistency of buttermilk; add additional flour
        or milk if needed. Let batter stand at room temperature for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a small, heavy skillet over medium heat. Melt 1 teaspoon butter
        in the hot skillet. Add 1/4 cup pancake batter and tilt the skillet to
        coat the bottom. Cook until pancake is nearly dry on top, about 2
        minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until browned, about 2
        minutes. Pancake may curl slightly, which is normal; if it curls too
        much, add more milk to remaining batter. Stack pancake on a plate and
        repeat with remaining butter and batter.
      </li>
    </ol>
