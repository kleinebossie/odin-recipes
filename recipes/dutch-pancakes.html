  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    My family moved here from Holland just before I was born. These Dutch
    pancakes, a little thicker and eggier than a crepe, are eaten in our
    family for breakfast or dinner. Serve rolled and topped with real maple
    syrup, fried apples, jam, or sugar. Leftovers are good eaten cold.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Beat eggs with a whisk in a large bowl. Add flour and whisk until
      mixture is smooth. Whisk in milk, sugar, and oil until well combined.
      Batter should be the consistency of buttermilk; add additional flour or
      milk if needed. Let batter stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a small, heavy skillet over medium heat. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in
      the hot skillet. Add 1/4 cup pancake batter and tilt the skillet to coat
      the bottom. Cook until pancake is nearly dry on top, about 2 minutes.
      Flip and cook on the other side until browned, about 2 minutes. Pancake
      may curl slightly, which is normal; if it curls too much, add more milk
      to remaining batter. Stack pancake on a plate and repeat with remaining
      butter and batter.
    </li>
