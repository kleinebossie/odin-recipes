# odin-recipes

"Recipes" project from https://www.theodinproject.com

This project is a website built solely with html at first, after which it was styled with css. Its homepage links to recipe pages, which each contain a different recipe. In this project, I learned how to structure webpages using html. I also learned how to style websites using css.
